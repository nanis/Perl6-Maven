How to get rid of duplicate values in an array in Perl 6?

=abstract end

<h2>Arrays with unique values</h2>

Basically they show various ways how one can take a list
of values and return a sublist of the same values
after eliminating the duplicates.

With Perl 6 its quite easy to eliminate duplicate values from a list as there
is a built-in called <hl>uniq</hl> that will do the job.

<code lang="perl6">
use v6;

my @duplicates = (1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1);
say @duplicates.perl;           # Array.new(1, 1, 2, 5, 1, 4, 3, 2, 1)
</code>
